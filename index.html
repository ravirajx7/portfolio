            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <div class="about-content">
                <div class="about-text">
                    <p>I'm Ravi Raj(रवि राज), a human being who works as an Engineer. I am originally from Ranchi, Jharkhand, India. I was born on september 8, 1996. I speak and write Hindi and English. </p>
                    </br>
                    <p>I enjoy exploring new places and websites. Discussing philosophy, cricket, and music are some of the favourite parts which I enjoy as human. I'm a free thinker who believes everyone should live their life in the way they like and should enjoy it to the fullest while it lasts.</p>
                    </br>
                    <p>I was privileged to get my first computer when I was 9 years old after fighting with my parents for playing games like GTA Vice City and IGI. Apart from games I liked drawing flags and houses in MS Paint </p>
                    </br>
                    <p>The real passion for engineering got sparked in me by my very first experience with programming in Logo when it was taught in my school. </p>
                    </br>
                    <p> It really struck me when I got to know that things in computers are not magic but actually set of instructions given to it. It motivated me to understand the technology in depth thus I decided to pursue my career in engineering.  </p>
                    </br>
                    <p> I thought just having motivation was enough but when I started struggling in writing simple programmes like Binary Search and Bubble Sort, I started questioned by ability. It was only when I broke the problems into smaller sub-problems and started being more curious I learnt the art of programming. </p>
                    </br>
                    <p>Since then, I learnt and explored many different technologies. I enjoyed breaking things to get better understanding. I enjoyed reading news at Hacker News and Slashdot which are truly the things which has always inspired me to continue doing this. </p>
                    </br>
                    <p>I got my first job right after my college and got very good guidance from my colleague and manager. I helped my team in building payment microservices and in e-commerce web application development. It was this company which gave me exposure for talking to clients and led me to learn the value of contextual knowledge in business. I also got to know that coding is the easiest part of developer's job. I joined Rocket Software and helped my team in design, development and maintenance of a content management system.
                    </p>
                    </br>
                    <p> Although, I have done full stack development since 2015, I enjoy doing backend development the most. I have experience of provisioning and managing infrastructure for enterprise applications. I am most proficient in Java, Spring and cloud native technologies like Docker and Kubernetes. </p>
