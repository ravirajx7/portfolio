                <p>I'm Ravi Raj (‡§∞‡§µ‡§ø ‡§∞‡§æ‡§ú), an engineer and a curious human being. I grew up in Ranchi, Jharkhand, India, and was born on September 8, 1996. I speak and write both Hindi and English fluently.</p>
                <p>I love exploring new places and websites. I enjoy talking about technology, philosophy, cricket, and music. I believe everyone should live life their own way and make the most of it while it lasts.</p>
                <p>My journey with technology started at age 9 when I got my first computer. I played games like GTA Vice City and IGI, but I also spent hours drawing mountains, rivers, and houses in MS Paint. My real interest in engineering began when I learned Logo programming in school.</p>
                <p>It amazed me that computers simply follow instructions. This realization pushed me to understand technology more deeply and pursue engineering. I struggled at first with simple programs like Binary Search, but breaking problems into smaller parts and staying curious helped me learn the art of programming.</p>
                <p>Since then, I've worked with a wide range of technologies. I've built applications in Java and React, worked with Elasticsearch, and designed cloud-native systems using Docker and Kubernetes. I have experience with secure authentication using OAuth and SSO, including Azure AD, and have built real-time features with WebSockets. I enjoy solving tough problems and building things from scratch.</p>
                <p>My work isn't just about code. I like getting to the root of tricky issues, joining customer calls, and working with my team to brainstorm, test, and experiment. I've mentored new developers and helped friends get started in programming. I believe a good team is built on trust, a sense of humor, and the courage to ask "why not?" as often as "why?"</p>
                <p>During college, I won tech quizzes and later, hackathons at work. But what I enjoy most is learning new things and sharing that excitement with others. I like to ask open-ended questions, think deeply, and never settle for surface-level answers. I value clear thinking, careful work, and a healthy dose of skepticism.</p>
                <p>I am comfortable with uncertainty and like to find new ways to solve problems. I enjoy connecting with everyone involved in a project, from engineers to stakeholders. Whether I'm tracking down a bug or coming up with a new idea, I bring independence, initiative, and a sense of fun to my work.</p>
                <p>If you're looking for someone who is technically strong, reliable, and genuinely passionate about building great things and great teams, let's connect. I'm always ready for a new challenge.</p>
